### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm Prateek Shrivastava â€” a data science leader with 12+ years of experience applying AI and analytics to solve complex problems across supply chain, marketing, and enterprise systems. I currently lead advanced analytics initiatives at Cummins, where I build predictive models and intelligent systems to drive operational impact and digital transformation. My previous roles at 84.51Â° (Kroger) and Vantiv have shaped a career grounded in measurable results and scalable solutions.

I grew up in a small town in central India â€” the kind of place where the monsoon carried memories more than material things. I wasnâ€™t driven by luxury or ambition early on, but by curiosity. As cable television reached India in the 90s, I was introduced to global stories through Discovery, National Geographic, and shows like *Globe Trekker*. That curiosity led me to mathematics, a degree in computer engineering, and eventually a master's in Information Systems in the U.S.

Since then, Iâ€™ve built a career working with Fortune 500 companies, contributing across domains from marketing analytics to retail intelligence and supply chain optimization. My work has been featured on platforms like *MarketingSherpa*, *InformationWeek*, and podcasts like *The Intelligent Leader*. Iâ€™ve spoken at INFORMS conferences, served on advisory boards, and actively mentor young professionals entering the field.

Iâ€™m passionate about making analytics accessible â€” through public speaking, pro bono consulting, and hands-on teaching. If youâ€™re a nonprofit, university, or early-career professional looking to collaborate or learn, Iâ€™d love to help.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) enthusiast, a lifelong vegetarian, and someone who values kindness, intellectual curiosity, and open dialogue. I'm currently thinking of starting a Substack to share thoughts on technology, economics, and politics.
